Getting to integers and adding them together with data validation.
Peer Review- Caroline Hana- The code runs with no issues and validates right. I like how instead of looping all the way to the beginning it just lets you put in the thing u did wrong if that makes sense. The wording was unique and not like everyone elses, very creative, I also liked how you validated your loop so if someone puts in the incorrect option it gives them the option to try again. Nice Job!
